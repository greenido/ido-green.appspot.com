	<h4>Paul Irish. Chrome DevRel. Q4</h4>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>The goal</h2>
	<p>
		We want rich web apps, that act responsively and present compelling experiences.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>The problem</h2>
	<p>
		Development takes time. Lots of time focused on common tasks rather than building unique experiences.

<section><blockquote>
Starting from a blank page is imtimidating.

<section><blockquote>
We didn't start with tools
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
Most of us haven't realized how innefficient we are. We can <strong>want more</strong>.
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
	Nowadays I go out of my way to learn one thing a day.
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
	Offline? I haven't implemented it because it hasn't been needed in a project. No client asked for it.
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
	Some developers are scared of the command line. The cost of getting into a new tool seems too high. Dependencies are scary.
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
	There are too many frameworks. The ramp up to them is too great; it slows you down.
</blockquote></section>
<section><blockquote>
	 To me this whole thing just feels like it needs bundling up properly with a brick ton of documentation and industry leaders saying "this is GOOD"

	<h2>Why are developers stuck?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Cognitive Overload
		<li>Clientside cost
		<li>Aversion to learning

	</ul>
</section>


<section>
	<h2>Cognitive overload.</h2>
	<p>
		Currently the onus is on developers to amass and absorb a huge amount of knowledge in order to be effective front-end developers. 
		<p>
		Browser support, progressive enhancement, fallback strategies, edge browser bugs, DOM performance, network performance, best tool for the job..

</section>

<section>
	<h2>Clientside cost. </h2>
	<p> All frontend code is a bandwidth cost passed on to users.
	<p> Thus, developers have an excuse for not adding client-side code to their stack.
	<p> Every robust solution is "bloated"
	</p>
</section>



<section>
	<h2>Aversion to learning.</h2>
	<p>
		 Because of the clientside cost aspect,  frontend developers stick to the tools they know.
		 
	<p> They're out of practice on ramping up on new tools; it's not engrained in their daily regimen.

<section goals>

	<h1>What are the goals?</h1>

	<h3>Learning and adopting tools are commonplace practice</h3>
	<h3>Defeat the "bloat" mindset</h3>
	<h3>Existing tools gain adoption</h3>
	<h3>New tools solve existing developer challenges</h3>
	<h3>Component Model and MDV get sufficient exposure</h3>

</section>

<section>
	<h2>Learning and adopting tools are commonplace practice</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Evangelize the message: don’t be scared of learning; you don’t have to start from scratch. 
		<li>Encourage to hack on working demos.
	</ul>
</section>


<section>
	<h2>Defeat the "bloat" mindset</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Launch onelessjpg.org - which shows that using one less jpg (or image compression) is equal to the cost of adding a “bloated” javascirpt library
		<li>Champion Build processes and deploy procedures
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Existing tools gain adoption</h2>

	<p>Show that existing tools capture best practices and save developers time in learning browser details. “Outsource esoteric browser detail tracking!”</p>

	<ul>
		
<li>Appcache generation & validation (work with Offline team)
<li>Demonstrate power of authoring abstractions like sass/compass, haml, markdown, coffeescript, boostrap
<li>Demonstrate power of an IDE or better prototyping tools
<li>Onboard more developers to Backbone
<!-- <li>See whats up with Brightly -->

	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>New tools solve existing developer challenges</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML5 Boilerplate Plus could present a new, blessed stack with better tools. 
<li>Modernizr command line interface, builder with community feature detects
<li>HTML5 Please to recommend best practices for polyfill implementation
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Improve Tools</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Work with jQuery standards team to improve browsers through standards process
<li>Work with jQuery standards team to improve jQuery with new features
<li>Get offline (appcache, indexeddb, filesystem) better support in Chrome DevTools
	</ul>
</section>


<section>
	<h2>Share Component Model and MDV externally</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Circulate MDV and Component Model in JS Developer circles.
		<li>Create a demo, screencast, and post of each. 
		<li>Gather feedback from key developers and liaison to webkit engineers
	</ul>
</section>

	<h1>So.... Q4</h1>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Q4</h2>

<ul>
<li>Gather developer feedback around framework tooling adoption to best identify goals. Present summarized report to team, highlighting developer challenges and our strategies to solve them 
<li> Create and launch new tools such as HTML5 Please, Modernizr CLI, community feature detection building 
<li> Improve 5 OWP APIs at the standards group or browser level based on library author feedback 
<li> Launch 1 site (onelessjpg.org) targeting developer consternation regarding clientside bloat to ease developer aversion to embiggening their stack 
</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h2>Q4... cont'd</h2>
	<ul>
<li> Circulate MDV and Component Model in JS Developer with a demo, screencast, and post of each. Gather feedback from key developers and liaison to webkit engineers 
	<ul><li>working with Rafael Weinstein and Dominic Cooney 
	</ul>
<li>QA for Clank compatability with existing popular projects
	<ul><li>prevent false positives in Modernizr, affirm compat with MBP, JQMs
	</ul>
</ul>
